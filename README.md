#### Description
I am a Self Learner who enjoys learning trending technologies. Currently, I am working as a PHP Developer Intern at ETL Labs Pvt Ltd with over 6 months of experience in building Content Management Systems, Admin Dashboards and Dynamic Websites.

I have a strong interest in Machine Learning but as it was not in my university curriculum, I have learnt it by myself. I am compatible to work with advanced Python Libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas and Scikit-Learn. I can also work on Data Pre-processing, Data Analytics and can perform linear regression on the given data set.

I am always ready to work in a team and motivate others with my tasks.
